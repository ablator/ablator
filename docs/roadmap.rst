Road Map
========

These are the things that ablator doesn't have, but still needs. If you feel like something is
missing here, or a feature is especially important to you, please open a GitHub issue. It will be
greatly appreciated ðŸ™‚.

Client Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Python:
    Already started. See the the `karman <https://github.com/ablator/karman>`_ Repository.

:Swift:
    In planning.

:Your Favourite Language?:
    Open an issue and let me know!

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot can be done here, simply optimizing the number of database calls, as well as moving to
caching the results of calculations and request.

Graphs
~~~~~~

Inclusion of various types of graphs in the Web UI (this goes hand in hand with the logging feature)

More Roll Out Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Roll Out strategies and Releases could cover a lot of ways that developers and product owners want
to roll out individual functionalities. To that end, ablator needs a few more ways to configure a
release period. Some of those are:

- Distinguish Between App Versions
- Slowly grow up to a certain percentage of users enabled
- Let in x number of users, but not on first come first server but distributed over time

Ablator As A Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maybe some day, if people are interested, ablator can run on a hosted server for a small fee. This
does not go against it being open source though. Sentry, a project which ablator draws a lot of
inspiration from, also manages to bridge the gap between open source and commercial in a great way.
