    <h4>How to use a Rollout Strategy</h4>
    <p>
        A release Rollout Strategy at which point in time you want to let in more users into your rollout
        program.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the <var>start at</var> date, ablator will enable flavors for all requesting users,
        until there are as many enabled users as <var>max enabled users</var>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can have many Rollout Strategies to define your roll out in advance, or just have one that
        you edit manually when you're ready to let in more users. Or add releases as necessary.
    </p>
        <h4>Roll Out Strategies</h4>
    <p>Ablator allows you to choose between these roll out strategies:</p>

    <h5><span class="badge badge-info">Release-Driven</span></h5>
    <p>During the rolling out process, it makes sense to have more fine-grained control over how your Functionality is enabled. This strategy lets in the amount of users you define in max enabled users</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-warning">Roll Out Paused</span></h5>
    <p>All new users will get the functionality disabled, but users who already had the functionality will get to keep it.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-success">Enabled Globally</span></h5>
    <p>Once you're satisfied the functionality works as intended and doesn't overwhelm your servers, use this roll out strategy to enable it for all users.</p>
    <h5><span class="badge badge-danger">Recall</span></h5>
    <p>Oops, you made a mistake. All users will have that functionality revoked, even those who had it enabled in some form before.</p>
